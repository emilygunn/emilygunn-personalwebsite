            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Emily Gunn, a Software Engineering student at BYU-Idaho. I am currently in my first semester, so I am very excited to learn a lot and dive into the technical world. So far, I have basic knowledge in Python as well as HTML and CSS and wish to continue learning those languages as well as others. I love learning about computers and all of the things that we can accomplish with them.</p>

            <h2>Why Me</h2>
            <p>Why should you hire me? I like to be organized and have things planned out to know exactly what I need to do and what needs to be done. I also enjoy having challenges that can be solved with creative solutions. I generally work well with people and try to work with and include other ideas when it comes to working with groups. While I try to have fun, I value working hard and doing quality work.</p>
